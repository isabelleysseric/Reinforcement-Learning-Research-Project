## Collada
<p>(COLLAborative Design Activity) is a format for 3D object.</p>
<p>The different files in this folder allow you to integrate each shape as a model in a simulator like Gazebo, Gazebo Ignition or other.</p>
<p>These files were created with the Blender software by exporting its file as a 3D object in Collada format, that is to say with the extension dae.</p>
<br>

**Types of models**:
- Fluids dynamics
- Particle dynamics
- Soft body dynamics

**List of models**:
- Ground
- Each object

**Ressources**:
<p>For more information on Collada's format, it's [here](https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/dae/) and for Blender's software, it's [here](https://www.blender.org/).</p>
